# Health Rate Monitor

## Project Description

The Health Rate Monitor is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to securely store, manage, and monitor vital health metrics. This decentralized application allows healthcare providers to record patient health data including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels while maintaining privacy and data integrity through blockchain technology.

The system provides real-time monitoring capabilities with automatic emergency alerts when critical health thresholds are exceeded, making it an ideal solution for continuous patient monitoring and telemedicine applications.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize healthcare data management by creating a secure, transparent, and accessible platform that:

- *Empowers Patients*: Gives individuals complete ownership and control over their health data
- *Enables Healthcare Providers*: Provides medical professionals with reliable, immutable health records
- *Ensures Data Security*: Leverages blockchain technology to protect sensitive medical information
- *Facilitates Emergency Response*: Automatically detects and alerts for critical health conditions
- *Promotes Interoperability*: Creates a standardized system for health data exchange across different healthcare providers
